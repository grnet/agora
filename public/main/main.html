    <h2>Welcome to the GÉANT Cloud Catalogue</h2>

    <p>A structured listing of cloud providers’ capabilities</p>

    <p>GÉANT facilitates and stimulates the adoption of cloud and
    application services in research and education.</p>
    
    <p>GÉANT’s cloud catalogue is a growing resource for the European
      research and education community with a structured listing of a
      number of service providers and cloud services. It provides
      NRENs and the research and education community with a quick and
      easy guide to cloud providers’ answers to the cloud requirements
      of the R&amp;E community, and aims to clarify the capabilities of
      providers, helping in the procurement of cloud services.</p>

      <p>A basic description of the included services are publicly
      available. Users from the GÉANT community can access the
      details, after logging in with their institutional account.</p>

      <p>For providers interested in joining the catalogue, more
      information is available on the
      <a href="http://suppliers.clouds.geant.net/">GÉANT website</a>.

      <h2>About GÉANT</h2>

      <p>In GÉANT the 40 European Research and Education Networks
      (NRENs) and joint European organizations collaborate, to make
      sure the right conditions of use are achieved: services which
      are safe and easy to use, accessible, affordable and
      interoperable.</p>

      <p>As the pan-European research and education network, GÉANT is
      the gateway for cloud providers to deliver their services to
      10,000 institutions, supporting 50 million users and researchers
      in more than 40 countries.</p>

      <p>GÉANT does not build application services itself. Rather, it
      is a delivery vehicle for application services from other
      organizations. These are both providers from the Research and
      Education community as well as commercial suppliers. All cloud
      providers are invited to include their cloud services in the
      catalogue, in order to present these to the research and
      education community. The basis for this online directory is a
      coordinated list of pan-European core requirements that cloud
      service providers are expected to meet.</p>
