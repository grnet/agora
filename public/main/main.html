    <h2>Welcome to the GÉANT Cloud Catalogue</h2>
    <p>As a pan-European research and education network, GÉANT is the
      gateway for cloud providers to deliver their services to 10,000
      institutions, supporting 50 million users and researchers in more than
      40 countries.</p>

    <p>All cloud providers are invited to include their cloud services
      in the catalogue, in order to present these to the research and
      education community. The basis for this online directory is a
      coordinated list of pan-European core requirements that cloud
      service providers are expected to meet.</p>

    <p>The catalogue, with its structured listing of cloud providers’
      answers to the cloud requirements, offers to the research and
      education community clarity about providers’ capabilities, which
      helps when procuring cloud services (subject always to their
      domestic procurement legislation and applicable EU threshold
      values).
